# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

<img src="/src/design/desktop-preview.jpg" />

## Hey there! How's it going?

This is my FIRST project built with REACT :tada:, a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects, it's working a lot to me.

This project consumes an API that provides advices, the [Advice SLip JSON AP](https://api.adviceslip.com/).
As the Frontend Mentor challenge me, I chose the random requisition mode of it, but this API provides advices also in other ways.

I built the page using:
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
